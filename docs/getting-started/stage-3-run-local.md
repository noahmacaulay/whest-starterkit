# Stage 3: Run Locally (In-Process Harness)

Stage 2 confirms the contract. Stage 3 actually scores you against the same MLPs the grader uses — but in-process, so you can drop `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` anywhere in `predict()` and step through it.

## 🚀 Run it

```bash
uv run whest run --estimator estimator.py --runner local
```

The default runner is `local` — you can omit `--runner local`. Defaults match the grader: `--n-mlps 10`, `--width 256`, `--depth 8`, `--flop-budget 1.7e10` (17B effective-compute budget), `--wall-time-limit 60.0`. See [CLI Reference](../reference/cli-reference.md) for the full list.

You'll see a Rich-rendered report with five panels:

1. **Run Context** — estimator class, path, timestamps, `n_mlps`, `width`, `depth`, `flop_budget`.
2. **Hardware & Runtime** — host, OS, CPU, RAM, Python and NumPy versions (so a leaderboard score is reproducible across machines).
3. **Sampling Budget Breakdown (Ground Truth)** — total FLOPs and time spent generating Monte-Carlo ground truth.
4. **Estimator Budget Breakdown** — same fields for your `predict()` call(s).
5. **Final Score** — the headline metrics:

```

With the zeros template, the raw `final_layer_mse` and `all_layers_mse` hover around 0.5 — the natural variance of the ReLU activations. The leaderboard metric `adjusted_final_layer_score` is a 10× discount of `final_layer_mse` (the multiplier hits the 0.1 floor) because the zeros template uses essentially none of the FLOP budget; `mean_score_multiplier` will read `0.10000000` for any cheap estimator. See [Scoring Model](../concepts/scoring-model.md) for the budget-adjustment formula and [score-report-fields.md](../reference/score-report-fields.md) for the full schema.

## Reproducing your own local runs

`whest run --seed 42` fixes the suite root from which every `mlp.seed` is derived deterministically. Re-running with the same `--seed` produces identical MLPs, identical ground truth, and (for estimators that seed their internal randomness from `mlp.seed`) identical predictions and scores. The grader uses its own fixed suite seed for actual submission scoring — so the property that matters for you is **same `mlp.seed` ⇒ same predictions**. Test this locally by running twice with the same `--seed` and diffing the JSON reports.

## FLOP-budget callout: Stage 1 vs Stage 3

Stage 1's `local_engine.compare_against_monte_carlo` uses `estimator_budget=1e9` (more headroom for prototyping at the tiny standalone shape). Stage 3's default is `flop_budget=1.7e10` (the grader effective-compute budget — caps `C_m = F_m + λ·R_m`, not just analytical FLOPs). If your estimator's cost grows fast (e.g. covariance propagation at large widths), your Stage 3 score may differ from Stage 1 — try `--flop-budget 1e11` to confirm before optimizing.

## Why a different MSE than Stage 1?

Stage 1 uses one fixed MLP (`build_mlp(width=32, depth=6, seed=0)`). Stage 3 generates a fresh suite of random MLPs at the grader shape `width=256, depth=8` (or loads a pre-created dataset via `--dataset`). Lower variance per MLP, but the average is what counts — and Stage 3 also applies the budget multiplier `max(0.1, C_m / B)` on top of the raw MSE, so Stage 3's `adjusted_final_layer_score` is generally smaller than Stage 1's pure MSE.

## Debugging

Because `--runner local` runs in-process, `pdb` works:

```python
def predict(self, mlp: MLP, budget: int) -> fnp.ndarray:
    import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    ...
```

## ✅ Expected outcome

| Estimator | Typical `adjusted_final_layer_score` (default settings, `--seed 42`) |
|---|---|
| Zeros template (`estimator.py`) | ~0.05 (raw `final_layer_mse ≈ 0.5` × 0.1 multiplier floor) |
| `01_random` | ~0.056 (raw `final_layer_mse ≈ 0.56`) |
| `02_mean_propagation` | ~7.7e-5 |
| `03_covariance_propagation` | ~3.7e-6 |
| `04_combined` | ~3.7e-6 (routes to covariance at the default budget) |

Same underlying analytical methods as the Stage 1 table, but the numbers differ because Stage 3 uses the grader shape (`width=256, depth=8`, `flop_budget=1.7e10`) and applies the budget multiplier `max(0.1, C_m / B)` on top of the raw MSE.
